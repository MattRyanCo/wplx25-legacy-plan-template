Contingency Plan - WordCamp Lisbon 2025 Template
Introduction
This contingency plan must be followed in case Fábio Nunes cannot continue to manage WPlus (death or total disability). The goal is to ensure the smooth transition and closure of the company's operations, with minimal impact to customers and partners.

1. Contact Backup Provider
The first step is to contact the Backup Provider, who will be the primary contact for the customers' migration.
Explain the situation and check if he is available to help with the migration of customers to a new supplier (this can be himself).
If the Backup Provider is not available or does not want to continue with all clients, ask them to help migrate the remaining clients to another provider.
Have prepared the list of all the websites managed by us on ClickUp, so that it can analyze before we contact customers.
2. Cancel Invoices and Subscriptions
Access ClickUp > Subscriptions and Recurring Invoices in Perfex CRM.
Contacting customers with active subscriptions, explaining the situation and informing them that the charges will be suspended.
Disable subscriptions and recurring invoices.
For each subscription and invoice, ask the customer if they agree with the migration or change of supplier.
3. Transfer Management to Backup Provider
After confirming the customers who will continue with the service, provide the Backup Provider with the complete list of customers who have accepted the migration.
For customers who do not accept, it will be their responsibility to find a new supplier.
The Backup Provider shall contact each customer to coordinate the migration of services, cancel contracts, and move servers as needed.
Have all the technical information accessible in ClickUp (domain, server, email, etc.) and ensure that the vendor has access to the necessary data.
4. Cancellation of Recurring Expenses
Access ClickUp and check all recurring expenses in the Expenses menu > Filter by Recurring.
Identify and contact providers to cancel non-essential services.
Start by canceling less critical expenses, but ensure that essential services such as servers are not canceled until all customers are migrated.
5. Review Automatic Payments
Check for ongoing automatic payments, such as charges directly to your business card or via automatic bank transfers.
Ensure that these payments are canceled to avoid unnecessary charges. This action is essential to avoid unnecessary expenses after the closure of operations.
6. Company Money Management
Make sure there is money left in the company's account, and check other payment platforms like Stripe or other processors.
Contact [Accountant] to discuss how to proceed with the management of the remaining funds. Instructions should be followed to ensure that everything is handled legally and properly.
7. Termination of the Company
The last step will be the formal closure of the company. The accountant should be consulted to ensure that all legal procedures are followed.
It will provide you with all the necessary guidance on how to shut down operations correctly and avoid legal complications.
Conclusion of the Contingency Plan
This plan aims to ensure the smooth transition and closure of the company's operations with minimal impact to customers and partners.

It is essential that everything is documented and accessible so that, if something happens, customers are treated with respect and legal and financial obligations are met.

In case of doubts, the accounting officer should be the first point of contact to ensure the correct execution of the plan.
